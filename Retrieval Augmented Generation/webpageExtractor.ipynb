Explores problem-solving and data analysis using Python, a programming language with a simple syntax and a powerful set of libraries. This course covers basic data types and collections (lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets), control flow, recursion, supervised machine learning via regression, visualization, information hiding and encapsulation using classes and objects, and introduces the analysis of program performance. Presents an integrated view of computer systems, from switching circuits up through compilers, and examines theoretical and practical limitations related to unsolvable and intractable computational problems. Other topics include the social and ethical dilemmas presented by such issues as software unreliability, algorithmic bias, artificial intelligence, and invasions of privacy.\n",

(More than half of CS50 students have never taken CS before!) This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today's newer languages, via which you'll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you'll understand all the more because of C. Toward term's end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project. See https://cs50.harvard.edu/college for advice, FAQs, syllabus, and what's new. Email the course's heads at heads@cs50.harvard.edu with questions.\n",

We are going through major transformations in businesses, sciences, as well as everyday life - collecting and analyzing data changes everything and data systems provide the means to store and analyze a massive amount of data.

We also study the history of data systems, traditional and seminal concepts and ideas such as the relational model, row-store database systems, optimization, indexing, concurrency control, recovery and SQL. In this way, we discuss both how and why data systems evolved over the years, as well as how these concepts apply today and how data systems might evolve in the future.

The course will be organized as both a reading group and a lab, building a community of people who are committed to K–12 CS education.

Throughout the course, either individually or with partners, you will develop an independent project that explores the design of K–12 computer science learning experiences.

      "Many processes in biology consist of step-by-step processes, whether in evolution, neural activity, development, or protein circuits. In many of these processes the actual steps taken by biological systems are not currently understood. Further, even the outcomes that are being realized by these processes are not well understood. In general, current understanding of most aspects of biology is not complete or specific enough to provide theories in which predictions can be made by analysis or computer simulation. Computer science is the study of step-by-step processes and of specifications of the outcomes that such processes can realize. For many computational outcome specifications, it is known or believed that no mechanism with feasible resources can realize them. Computer science therefore offers a top-down approach to understanding what could possibly be computed in biology, and how. In this course we shall pursue this computational complexity approach, whose origins go back to Turing and von Neumann. Emphasis will be on evolution and neuroscience, but other topics such as development will be also discussed.

Differential privacy provides a concrete measure of privacy loss, and differentially private algorithms are equipped with a parameter for controlling this loss. A signal property of differential privacy is closure under composition, meaning that we can understand and control the cumulative privacy loss as the data are subjected to multiple analyses. In consequence, differential privacy is programmable: one can combine simple differentially private computational primitives in creative ways to obtain privacy-preserving algorithms for complex analytical tasks. The course will cover (1) the basics of differential privacy: the definition and its properties, computational primitives, and composition theorems; (2) selected advanced differentially private algorithms drawn from the literature and a wide range of application areas from industry to the US Census; and (3) applications of differential privacy to validity and replicability of data analyses.\n",

However, the question of what approach is best for what context remains elusive. In this course, we will focus on computational properties of interpretable machine learning methods, such as faithfulness or stability. Assessing methods with respect to these properties may allow us to rule out poorly-performing approaches without the need for expensive user studies. By categorizing methods by their computational properties, we will also be able to start thinking about which methods might be useful for a specific context.

Foundational topics covered will include: Monge and Kantorovich formulations of OT, duality, entropy regularization, Gromov-Wasserstein distances, dynamic formulations, and Benamou-Brenier theory. Each of these will be presented in the context of their use for specific problems in machine learning, including domain adaptation, generative models, correspondence analysis, and gradient flows. The course combines theoretical rigor with practical exercises, implementing OT algorithms and analyzing their impact on real-world machine learning challenges. The classes will consist of a combination of instructor-led lectures on fundamentals and student-led discussion of relevant academic papers.
